## Hi there 👋
I'm a Rust and Web developer, currently coding as a hobbist
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain, especially [Solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana)

### 🌍 Natural Languages
I'm a Vietnamese guy living in Czech Republic
- 🇻🇳 Vietnamese - native language
- 🇬🇧 English - excellent reading and hearing skills, useable writting skills, my speaking skills is just enough for basic/daily conversations
- 🇨🇿 Czech - I have completed the maturita 🎓 examination, but my Czech skills are fading slowly due to the amount of works using the Czech language, now it's only useable for daily conversations

### 👨‍💻 Programming Languages
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - I have been working with Rust for almost 4 years, [since rust 1.25](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/29/Rust-1.25.html), it's the language that I have the most confident with :muscle:
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)/[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I have 2 years experience with it, but never use it in a serious project due to its unstable nature
- C ([C99](https://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard)) - use it for school project, I aced all the tests by just thinking about how the Rust compiler would yelling at me :sweat_smile:

### :coffee: Frameworks
I have tried a lot of frameworks, these are my favorite one
- [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) - create a web SPA using WebAssembly
- [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) - create native GUI app using web technologies (like Electron but in Rust)
- [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) - quickly create a GUI app with no fancy feature
- [Actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) - create a fast web server
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - quickly create a Node web server
- [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) - create a Discord bot

### :hammer: Tools
These are my everyday tools out of *hundred* of tools that I have on my machine
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - My main text editor/IDE
- [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE for HTML/CSS/JS development
- [https](https://github.com/thecoshman/http) - to quickly serve files from a directory, mainly for testing WebAssembly app 
- [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) - to avoid building a dependency multiple times


### ⚡ Fun fact
- My nickname `tmokenc` is pretty unique, if you happen to know any profile using this nickname, 99% it's me
- I use too much Vim, now I cannot go back to other text editors without Vim mode (e.g. Microsoft Word)
